Molcami2_mod.sh - CASSCF SP, should be fine unless you run into an SCF convergence issue where it says something like “not converged” at the end. However, if this happens, it is not useful to just run again since you will get the same error. You instead need to change the Molcas input to read in the best “trial wave function” to keep improving it. Paulami can help with this (it means to read in the RasOrb file and ask to use it with the lumorb keyword in RASSCF module)

Now that I think about it, I recommend to skip the Molcami2_mod.sh and 1st_to_2nd_mod.sh steps. Those run VDZ calculations but I think we need to run directly with 2nd_to_3rd_mod.sh but we need to modify it to read orbitals from SCFopt step instead of VDZ step (edited) 





9:17
You then can run sp_to_opt_VDZP_mod.sh

In this step, we need the script to monitor the optimization and, if it does not converge, ask to restart but start from the last geometry step instead of starting again from the beginning

Then for finalPDB_mod.sh and fitting_ESPF.sh there should be no issues unless there is another serious problem, so no need to have a retry for those

Yes Dr. concerning the retries, I actually needed to include an if/else statement for retrial just to ensure to update the  status of each script when it finishes from Running to Passed. Concerning QMMM, I think I will understand it better as we go through the explanation once more in our APEC meeting, because I am still not familiar with the runs and structure, and kind of files which are important for each run and when does it finish usually and which criteria is best to use to make sure each script finished successfully.
