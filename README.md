# Automated APEC-F 2.0

## Background
![This is an alt text.](toc_figure.png "This is a sample image.")

The construction of QM/MM models is usually a laborious and error-prone task that requires advanced user expertise. Furthermore, most traditional QM/MM methods only offer users a choice between using accurate electronic structure methods, which limits sampling, or approximate methods that allow for more extensive sampling of the protein dynamics. We focus on the large and important class of flavoproteins---it is estimated that around 1-3% of proteins are naturally bound to flavin, including three of the six major classes of photoreceptor proteins---for which we have developed and automated a computational protocol that automatically generates a QM/MM optimized model starting from a pdb crystal structure and a simple user input. The model uniquely makes use of the rigidity of flavinâ€™s tricyclic core structure, freezing its coordinates during the molecular dynamics but optimizing it iteratively during the QM/MM steps to allow for the calculation of an averaged interaction between the QM and MM subsystems.
